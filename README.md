Kaggle Landmark Recognition Challenge
I downloaded and stored the compressed images in hard disk. 
Organized the files into folders based on their class. The dataset has 14591 classes, so this organized files are in 14951 folders. 
(For example all Colosseum files are organized into the folder 6051, St. Peter's Basilica images are in folder 9633 etc.)

Since it's a huge file, I trained on a small subset of 20 folders using Google's MobileNet_v1_1.0_224.
